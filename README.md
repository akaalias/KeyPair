# KeyPair makes using keyboard shortcuts during pair programming sessions easier

The problem is that when one person is the “driver” in a pair programming session and the other is the ‘navigator’, when the driver uses keyboard shortcuts (while using the IDE for example) things start happening on the screen for the ‘navigator’ but it’s unclear why (because the navigator is looking at the screen, not the driver’s hands)

So, the app I made is a small window that shows when the driver uses any keyboard shortcuts that are triggered with the command, option, control, shift and function keys. 

From simple things like Command-C/Command-V for copy and paste to complex commands like Command-shift-enter for code refactoring in IntelliJ.
